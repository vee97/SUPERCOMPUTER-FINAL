## Circuit Connections
- photoresistor to A0
- pressure sensor to A1
- potentiometer to A2

- SDA to A4
- SCL to A5
- GND to GND
- VCC to VIN

-D9 to D8 of connected device
*note: Both connected devices must have the same ground.

###### CONTROL PANEL & CENTRAL BRAIN CODE
This code allows the control panel Arduino to read and check input values,
display corresponding images on the Central Brain, and send appropriate
information to each connected Arduino Nano using Software Serial.
